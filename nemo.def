#	Unresolved issues / future work:
#		- significant testing needed - does OpenMPI version on Cirrus need to the same as version in this def file?
#		- do we _need_ to (should we) run all available `make [check|test]` for dependencies?
#		- did I waste a lot of time working out how to compile dependencies from source? (David H suggested that some apt binaries might work, despite my comment below!)
#		- we could change the workflow of all of this by creating individual docker files of all the dependencies (with same base OS image, probably something minimal? alpine?),
#		  doing a multistage build, and creating the singularity container from the final resultant docker container. Singularity doensn't (yet) allow multistage builds
#		- one of the issues I had running `make check` for hdf5 was with running it as root - mpiexec complains about this. I created the nemo user to run (with the side effect that
#		  it created a useful location - the home directory - to store some of the dependencies!). But I then had issues with adding the hdf5 libraries to search paths used by NetCDF, nemo, and xios,
#		  so changed --prefix from /home/nemo/hdf5 to /usr/local, but you can't install stuff to there without being root (or sudo, which isn't directly supported in a container). Way round it would be
#		  build in /home/nemo as nemo, then install as root, and switch back to nemo user? Is it worth it? But only need to worry about this if we want to run `make check`. Also had similar issues with
#		  NCDIR and NFDIR for NetCDF install directories (changed from /home/nemo/netcdf/install to /usr/local). If there's a way round it (and there's a reason to do it), then LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH
#		  will need to be set and updated
#
#		  I also thought it would be useful to keep all the 3rd party dependencies in a separate place, rather than /usr/local, but maybe that's just being a bit OCD...
#		- the nemo-singularity repo is currently private, so need to supply a username/password
#		- I keep the def file in a different repo to the singularity nemo build because	it is a different thing - someone running `singularity build` doesn't need the whole singularity-nemo repo (apart from
#		  inside the container)	
#
#		- note I currently change branch in the nemo singularity repo rather than use master
