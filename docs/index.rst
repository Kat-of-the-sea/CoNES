CoNES User Guide

Welcome to the Containeristaion of NEMO Employing Singularity (CoNES) User Guide!

This guide aims to give an overview of how to build and run a NEMO Singularity
Image File (SIF). Dependancies, worked examples and how to integrate the build
and distribution process with GitHub will also be covered.

This is by no means a definitive guide and not the only way to achieve the 
containeristaion of an Ocean Model!
